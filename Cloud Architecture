Cloud Archtecture refers to the design and structure of the vaious components that make up a cloud computing environment.
Cloud computng involves dlivering computing services over the internet, and cloud architectur is the blueprint for how these  serevices are organized, integrated, and delivered.

 key components of cloud architecture include:

## Cloud Service Models:
  # Infrastructure as a Service : Provide virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  # Plant as a service : Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications with the complexities of infrastructure.
  # Software as a Service: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for users to install, manage, and maintain the software.

## Cloud Deploment Models:
   # Public Cloud: Services are provided by third-party cloud service provider and ar made available to the general public. Examples includ AWS, Azure, And Google Cloud platform.
   # private cloud: Infrastrucure and services are maintained for a specific organiztion and ar not shared with other organizations.
## scalability and Elasticity:
   # Scalability: the ability to handle increasing workloads by adding resources.
   # Elasticity: the ability to automatically scale resourcs up or down based on demand.

Effective cloud architecture is crucial for optimizing performance, ensuring security, and achieving cost efficiency.
